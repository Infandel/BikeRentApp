For deploying on git pages

<<<<<<< HEAD
Not fully functional, but i tried my best. App for gathering data on bikes and their rental trips.

Everything is based on the examples of Workberry school video series on Ember.js

The sad part is that From video 3.18 and till 4.2 is a HUUUUUGE gap in storytelling.

I didn't get the point how to build my own book component inside of author template with all
credentials.
Same goes for reviews building part. 
Hopefully i could find somewhere these missing parts on implementing book and reviews templates.

With all regards. Infandel.
