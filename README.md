# bike-rent-app

Not fully functional, but i tried my best.

Everything is based on the examples of Workberry school video series on Ember.js

The sad part is that From video 3.18 and till 4.2 is a HUUUUUGE gap in storytelling.

I didn't get the point how to build my own book component inside of author template with all
credentials.
Same goes for reviews building part. 
Hopefully i could find somewhere these missing parts on implementing book and reviews templates.

With all regards. Infandel.
